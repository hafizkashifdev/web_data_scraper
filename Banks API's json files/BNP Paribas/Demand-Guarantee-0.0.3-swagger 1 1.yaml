      `The API supports following functionalities:`
      * Request for application :  Sent by the party requesting issuance of the undertaking (applicant or obligor) to the party issuing the undertaking (demand guarantee or standby letter of credit or dependent undertaking or counter-guarantee or counter-standby) and provides details on the applicable rules, terms, conditions and content of the undertaking to be issued.
      * Amendment of an already issued undertaking (reduction, release, extend, cancellation or termination)
      * Demand for payment or extension of undertaking expiry date

      `Error Responses`

      The API uses common HTTP status codes in the response header to indicate success or failure. Specific error code and description will be returned in the custom error schema.

      `Query Parameters`

      Each URL query parameter specifies an API query parameter that must be URL encoded.

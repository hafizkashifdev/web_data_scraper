   title: Funds Confirmations (PSD2 STET)
   description: "## Overview\nThird Party Providers can consume the PSD2 PIISP APIs\
      \ to check if a given amount can be covered by the liquidity that is available\
      \ on a Connexis Cash user cash account.\n\nOur API allows TPPs to check if a\
      \ customer has enough funds in his account on behalf of CONNEXIS CASH users.\
      \ This API intends to provide an interface between:\n\n+ Payment Instrument\
      \ Issuer Service Providers (**PIISP**)\n\n+ Third Party (Payment Service) Providers\
      \ (**TPP**)\n\n\nTPP act with the Payment Instrument Issuer Service Providers\
      \ (**PIISP**) role.\n\n\nThe Payment Service User (**PSU**) is the owner of\
      \ the accounts held by the ASPSP and gives accreditations to the TPP in order\
      \ to access his accounts information or initiates payment from these accounts.\n\
      \n\nTPPs can now offer coverage payment checks to customers using CONNEXIS CASH\
      \ eBanking solution.\n\n\n\n## User Consent\n\n\nCONNEXIS CASH chose the Full-AISP\
      \ model (A1 from the STET documentation) : CONNEXIS CASH does not require to\
      \ be informed of the details of the PSU consent. Whatever the AISP request,\
      \ the CONNEXIS CASH will respond, being unable to check the compliance of the\
      \ request against the user choices.\n*The PUT/Consent request is only applicable\
      \ in the Mixed model (A2 of the STET documentation), CONNEXIS Cash will not\
      \ implement such request in the sandbox environment and in the production environment.\
      \ In accordance with the PSD2, a TPP and a PSU must have a contractual relationship.*\n\
      \n\n## API Architecture\n\n\nThe API is designed on a REST FULL model using\
      \ JSON structures. Our API is based on STET (1.4.0.47) format.\n## Sandbox\n\
      A sandbox environment is available to facilitate the onboarding and learning\
      \ process of the TPP.\n\nThose APIs return fake data. No sensitive information\
      \ shall be shared through the sandbox environment.\n\nOn the sandbox environment,\
      \ Client_credential is the only OAuth 2.0 flow available.\n\n## Production\n\
      The URL of the production environment is **https://psd2.api.cib.bnpparibas.com/**.\
      \ \n\nThe Authorization code url is : **https://api.cib.bnpparibas.com/oauth2/v1/authorize?client_id={cliend_id}&response_type=code&scope={scopes}&redirect_uri={redirect_uri}&state={state}**.\n\
      \nThe TPP must use the OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant flow for AISP, PISP or\
      \ PIISP scope.\nThe production environment can only be accessed according to\
      \ the full STET standard and requires a qwac certificate delivered by a QTSP.\n\
      For a manual onboarding, the TPP should provide its QWAC certificate, callback\
      \ URL, and EBA reference code to **dl.cib.api.psd2.support@bnpparibas.com**\n\
      ## Support\nNeed support? We are here to help you\n\nIn case of technical issue\
      \ between you as TPP and the bank, please contact us at the following email\
      \ address : **dl.cib.api.psd2.support@bnpparibas.com**\n\nPlease be aware that\
      \ the client can always contact us via his usual BNPP representative as the\
      \ issue might come from a wrong set up in the client contract.\n## Fallback\
      \ Process\nAs part of its legal obligations under PSD2, BNPP CIB implements\
      \ a fallback mechanism. \nThis fallback solution is not available in sandbox\
      \ environment with fake data.\n\n**Prerequisite**\n\nThis process allows developers\
      \ to use fallback mechanism only in case the dedicated API is not available\
      \ and in compliance with the regulation (EU) 2018/389.\n\n**URL Fallback**\n\
      \nThe Fallback URL for TPP is the same URL as Connexis Cash customers : https://connexis.bnpparibas.com/\n\
      \n**TPP identification** \n\nThe same requirements regarding identification\
      \ of TPPs with QWACs apply irrespective of whether the TPPs are accessing the\
      \ users’ payment accounts via the dedicated interface or via Connexis Cash.\
      \ The identification of TPPs towards Connexis Cash should be based on the use\
      \ of qualified certificates for website authentication (QWACs).\n\n**Strong\
      \ customer authentication through Connexis Cash**\n\nTo access Connexis Cash,\
      \ the user have to enter his customer credentials. TPP developers can connect\
      \ to our online banking with this customer credentials in order to retrieve\
      \ PSD2 data.  \n"

         summary: Payment coverage check request (PIISP)
         description: "### Description\n\nThe PIISP can ask an ASPSP to check if a\
            \ given amount can be covered by the liquidity that is available on a\
            \ PSU cash account or payment card.\n\nThe calculation rules regarding\
            \ the availability of funds are the same than the one currently used in\
            \ Connexis Cash. For instance, if the total calculated is “negative”,\
            \ the existing service will verify the allowed credit coverage on the\
            \ concerned and associated accounts.\nFurthermore if the currency of transfer\
            \ is different than the account currency, the existing Connexis Cash service\
            \ will proceed to a currency conversion. The answer to the request will\
            \ take the currency conversion into account and will be “true” or “false”\
            .\nThe Connexis Cash services offers to possibility to operate in ‘ForceThrough’\
            \ mode, in such cases the availability of funds check is bypassed. For\
            \ such setups the API response will always be ‘true’ irrespective of the\
            \ availability of funds.\nThe requests with an IBAN will be executed,\
            \ but not the one with a combination Identification/SchemeName/Issuer:\
            \ this one is used to identify a party (for instance Ultimatedebtor) but\
            \ not to identify an account in Connexis Cash.\n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\
            \n- The TPP has been registered by the Registration Authority for the\
            \ PIISP role. (not mandatory for Sandbox)\n- The TPP and the PSU have\
            \ a contract that has been enrolled by the ASPSP (not mandatory for Sandbox)\
            \           \n    - At this step, Connexis Cash has delivered an OAUTH2\
            \ access token to the TPP via OAuth2 flow : Authorization Code Grant (for\
            \ production) or Client Credential (for sandbox).\n\n        For more\
            \ details about OAuth2 flow, please click on the links below : \n\n  \
            \      - Authorization Code Grant flow : https://developers.cib.bnpparibas.com/docs/auth2-ac-psd2\n\
            \n        - Client Credential flow : https://developers.cib.bnpparibas.com/docs/auth2-cc\n\
            \n- The TPP and the ASPSP have successfully processed a mutual check and\
            \ authentication\n- The TPP has presented its OAUTH2 access token\n###\
            \ Specific for the Sandbox\n\n\n- In order to be able to test the functioning\
            \ of the request, fake data are at TPP’s disposal. This concerns several\
            \ accounts (IBAN) with associated amounts and currencies:\n\n<table>\n\
            \  <tr>\n    <th>IBAN</th>\n    <th>Balance</th>\n    <th>Currency</th>\n\

            \    <td>322.82</td>\n    <td>DKK</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n- The TPP\
            \ can do some testing by indicating in the request body the instructed\
            \ amount, and the account associated to its request (IBAN)\n\n- The paymentCoverage\
            \ parameter must be completed to get a 200 response, but beware, it is\
            \ necessary to take the following points into account:\n\n  - The currency\
            \ of the instructed amount must be the same as the account currency. In\
            \ the Mock Server context, there will be no currency conversion to confirm\
            \ the availability of funds\n\n  - The instructed amount must be above\
            \ 0, otherwise a code and an error message will be returned\n\n  - The\
            \ mock server checks the format of the IBAN but does not run a check on\
            \ the format per country.\n\n  - The AccoundId field must only be an IBAN.\
            \ The Identification/SchemeName/Issuer combination is not taken into account\
            \ by Connexis. It is necessary to indicate an IBAN present in the above\
            \ Fake Data table; otherwise a (406) code and an error message will be\
            \ returned.\n\n  - The “Signature” and “X Request ID” parameters will\
            \ not be verified by our sandbox for\nthe test. They must be not null.\n\
            \n- The other parameters can be modified; however they will not be captured\
            \ by the bank and will not be treated.\n\n### Business Flow\n\nThe PIISP\
            \ requests the ASPSP for a payment coverage check against either a bank\
            \ account or a card primary identifier. The ASPSP answers with a structure\
            \ embedding the original request and the result as a Boolean.\n"

            API:
            This date can be used in the following cases:
            - the single requested execution date for a payment having several instructions. In this case, this field must be set at the payment level.
            - the requested execution date for a given instruction within a payment. In this case, this field must be set at each instruction level.
            - The first date of execution for a standing order.
            When the payment cannot be processed at this date, the ASPSP is allowed to shift the applied execution date to the next possible execution date for non-standing orders.
            For standing orders, the [executionRule] parameter helps to compute the execution date to be applied.

            This data attribute defines the behaviour when recurring payment dates falls on a weekend or bank holiday.
            The payment is then executed either the "preceding" or "following" working day.
            ASPSP might reject the request due to the communicated value, if rules in Online-Banking are not supporting
            this execution rule.

<h1>Glossary</h1>
<h2>Account Information</h2>
<p>
  When used in Open Banking, ​Account information​ refers to an API that gives
  access to account and transaction information. To gain that access there needs
  to be two types of authorisation. On one side, the entity accessing the API
  must be an authorised institution (known as an AISP). On the other side, the
  person or business that owns that account (called the PCU) must give the AISP
  permission to access that specific account.
</p>
<h2>AISP</h2>
<p>
  An AISP (Account Information Service Provider) is authorised by a competent
  authority to access the account and transaction information of individuals and
  businesses who have given it permission do so. An AISP might use this access
  to provide a aggregation service, for example, allowing people to see several
  of their bank accounts in one place.
</p>
<h2>AML</h2>
<p>Anti-money laundering processes, regulations and laws.</p>
<h2>ASPSP</h2>
<p>
  The ASPSPs (Account Servicing Payment Service Providers) are the account
  providers, such as Tide, that offer read/write APIs. These APIs provide access
  to customer account information (for example, to AISPs) and also allow
  third-party providers (TPPs) to initiate payments from the account provider’s
  customers’ accounts.
</p>
<p>
  The customer must give specific permission to the entity that wants to access
  their account information and initiate payments on their behalf.
</p>
<p>There are two types of ASPSP:</p>
<p>
  Mandatory: in the UK, these are the initial nine banks that are taking part in
  Open Banking. Voluntary: these are institutions that have chosen to take part
  in Open Banking.

  Competent Authority based in another EU state.

  authorised to take part in the Open Banking ecosystem. The directory handles
  authentication between registered providers.
